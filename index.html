                <h3>Stock Market Project</h3>
                <p>This is a Java project simulating a stock market, featuring classes like Stock Market Project and Flower Shares. It builds a simple stock trading environment where users can interact with shares and manage purchases through a GUI. The code handles stock transactions, displays information, and simulates market activities. The project demonstrates practical use of Java object-oriented programming concepts and graphical user interface design, making it a great showcase for applying Java skills in a real-world scenario.</p>

                <h3>Intro Web Scraper</h3>
                <p>The "Public Web Scraper" is a Python project designed to demonstrate the basics of web scraping by targeting manhwa (as an example) sites. It features critical scripts like manhwa graber for data extraction and web scap chaplist for managing chapter lists. This project showcases practical scraping techniques, providing a real-world coding example perfect for those learning Python and web scraping. </p>

                <h3>AI Driven Test Generation</h3>
                <p>HPCG Testing and Artifact Generation is an ongoing research effort into using new and different tools in code development. This includes but is not limited to seeing how different AI tools perform better for specific tasks and how you can change statements to provide the best results for the project you are working on. We have seen how different AI tools change their outputs based on their place in the development cycle. In addition to the idea, some AI tools are not very good at performing jobs of testing larger systems. </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Connor. I am a current undergraduate student at St.John's University in Minnesota. I major in Computer Science, but my interests are more in parallel processing and the tools people can use to speed up their development process. This is a fascinating area regarding the widespread application of the results. Moving away from computers, I am interested in sustainability and how we can improve code for people and the planet. </p>
